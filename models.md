# Data Model Specifications

This page contains the specifications on how to use the data models found on our github pages:

* LIBRS Models - [https://github.com/teisdbr/LibrsDataModels](https://github.com/teisdbr/LibrsDataModels)
  * Contains the models used for our JSON Validator, as well as the NIBRS-Based model, which includes a NIBRS Report plus the other things that LIBRS cares about (vendors need to create the constructors between the two).
* NIBRS Models - [https://github.com/teisdbr/NibrsDataModels](https://github.com/teisdbr/LibrsDataModels)
  * Contains the NIBRS IEPD Report as C# Objects.

# LIBRS Data Models

These models are meant to be a simplification of the existing Flat File format, but still meant to be compatible with it. For instance, in some places entire segments have been removed and rolled into other ones (EG: Segment 51 - Victim Injury is gone, and instead injuryType is just a property of Victim now).

<br/>

## [Quick Start](#quick-start)

To get down to it, the easiest way to start incorporating the LIBRS JSON models would be to convert existing Flat Files to JSON Format, and compare the inputs and outputs. You can do this with the ValidateFFtoJSON Endpoint. See below for details. You can also view more in-depth information on the Swagger Page for the API: [https://json.librs.org:5000/swagger/index.html](https://json.librs.org:5000/swagger/index.html) ***Note:*** It's been brought to our attention that Swagger will remove the New Line characters from the request, which will cause the FFToJson and ValidateFFToJson requests to fail. The recommended workaround is to use Postman.

### API Endpoints

Currently the JSON Validator is hosted at [https://json.librs.org:5000](https://json.librs.org:5000).

| Endpoint              | Body Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| /api/jsonvalidate     | An RVO (Root Validation Object) containing an array of LIBRS Incidents to be processed. Body should be formatted as application/json. No authentication/authorization is required for validation. | This is the API Endpoint that will take one an RVO with any number of JSON-formatted LIBRS Incidents, and return the validation plus the original object as an extended RVO. Can be used to both validate and submit data.                                                                  |
| /api/fftojson         | A LIBRS Flat File (Whole thing, Header to Footer). Can contain as many incidents as desired. Body should be formatted as text/plain. No authentication/authorization is required for use.         | This Endpoint will take an existing LIBRS Flat File, and convert it to an RVO. This is useful when first getting started so you can see how the old Flat File segments have been converted into Objects. This endpoint does not store any data, and cannot be used for monthly submissions. |
| /api/validatefftojson | A LIBRS Flat File (Whole thing, Header to Footer). Can contain as many incidents as desired. Body should be formatted as text/plain. No authentication/authorization is required for use.         | Similar to FFtoJSON, this endpoint will also validate the converted JSON File, returning both the converted RVO and validations of the Incident(s) to the User.                                                                                                                             |

### JSON Process

* **Validation**:
  * **The JSONValidate public endpoint is currently in "validation-only" mode, meaning it only checks the validity of the data without storing or tracking it. Agencies can use this endpoint as frequently as needed, independent of the actual submission process**
* **Submission:**
  * Agencies submit JSON files to their designated LIBRS FTP data folder.
  * Each JSON file should correspond to a specific report month. See the LIBRS Data model for the JSON format.
* **Processing:**
  * The LIBRS batch processor will handle the files once submitted.
  * The files are processed in "submit" mode, and automated emails and files are generated and placed into the agencies' corresponding FTP folders.
  * The JSON file is moved to “Processed” FTP folder appended with the LIBRS run number.
* **Handling Errors:**
  * Files that fail validation are moved to a “failed” FTP folder.
  * Files submitted out of sequence or before the agency's start date are moved to an “outofsequence” FTP folder.
  * Logs are created to document the failure for review and troubleshooting.
* **Post-Processing:**
  * Scorecard and error detail reports are available in the agencies' FTP folders.
  * Interactive analytics are accessible via TrackCrime.
  * If the agency is certified, accepted LIBRS data is forwarded to the FBI.
* **Security and Authorization:**
  * Agencies must use their LIBRS FTP credentials to ensure authorized submissions.
  * Agencies that need to test submissions with a new vendor or during transitions may require a separate Agency and FTP account for the recertification period.

## [Root Validation Object](#root-validatior-object)

This is the primary object that is used in the JSON Validator. It contains the following properties/objects:

| Property Name                       | Data Type               | Description                                                                                                       | Required                                |

## [Librs Incident Object](#librs-incident-object)

The LibrsIncident object is the object that will be populated for each Incident that is being submitted. You'll notice that not all Flat File Segments are represented by child objects. This is because we have been working on simplifying the objects where we can. For instance, Segment 41 - Offender Using/Gaming is gone, and instead represented by a property in the Offender Object.

***THIS IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE*** - Don't hold this as gospel. We will probably make more changes to this to make things simpler, like rolling in the Arrestee Statute Segment into the Arrestee, as well.

Basically, the only things that are required are what make it an Incident - Admin, Offense, and a Victim. And we also need to know the Incident Number and if it's an insertion or a deletion, so Action Type and Incident Number are also needed. Everything else can be left out of the JSON Object if it's not relevant (EG: Property Segment 30 for an Aggravated Assault).

### [Admin Object](#admin-object)

This is a C# Object that represents the existing Administrative Segment (10) from the Flat File. Some properties have been pulled out into the Root Validation Object (RVO) and thus don't need to be repeated here or in other segments.

| Property Name        | Data Type | Description                                                                             | Required                                                  |

### [Property Object](#property-object)

This is a C# Object that represents the existing Property Segment (30) from the Flat File. This Object is optional if you have no information to give us (EG: The only offense is an Aggravated Assault and has nothing to do with stolen vehicles). If you don't include it, we fill in a blank object automatically, so the number of stolen and recovered vehicles will be the same as if they were left as blank spaces in the Flat File.

This may go away in the future and be tallied based on the Property Descriptions that are given to us, since all it contains is the number of stolen and recovered vehicles.

| Property Name          | Data Type | Description                                                                      | Required |
| ---------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| NumOfStolenVehicles    | Integer   | Number to define the number of vehicles that were stolen in an Incident. (DE 18) | No       |
| NumOfRecoveredVehicles | Integer   | Number to define the number of vehicles that were stolen in an Incident. (DE 19) | No       |

**Example**

```json
"propertySeg": {
                "numOfStolenVehicles": 1,
                "numOfRecoveredVehicles": 1
            }

### [Errors Object](#errors-object)

The Errors Object is equivalent to the Error Details that are provided in the Flat File's Error Detail Report. We provide them back here so that the JSON Validator's API can be called within the RMS, and errors can be directly returned to the User.

This is a Read-Only object, you won't be sending this along with your data, only getting it back.

| Property Name  | Data Type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ErrorCode      | Integer   | The Error Code of the Error (Typically a 5-Digit Number)                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ErrorMsg       | String    | The text of the Error Code describing what's wrong                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Contents       | String    | The particular data that was submitted that the validation had an issue with                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| DataElem       | String    | The particular data elements that the validation had an issue with                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| SegmentNumber  | String    | Legacy, but the equivalent of the Segment Number as it refers to the JSON Object that the validation error came from (Will get updated to just say what the name of the object was, but for now it spits out something like 20 if it doesn't like and Offense) |

### [Warnings Object](#warnings-object)

The Warnings Object is basically the same thing as the Errors Object, but just for warnings. Makes it easy to keep the actual Errors that are preventing the Incident from being accepted separate from just Warnings about it.

This is a Read-Only object, you won't be sending this along with your data, only getting it back.

| Property Name | Data Type | Description                                                                  |
| ------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ErrorCode     | Integer   | The Warning Code of the Warning (Typically a 5-Digit Number)                 |
| ErrorMsg      | String    | The text of the Warning Code describing what's wrong                         |
| Contents      | String    | The particular data that was submitted that the validation had an issue with |
| DataElem      | String    | The particular data elements that the validation had an issue with           |

## Legacy LIBRS Values

In order to maintain compatibility with the existing codebase, we had to bring forward some legacy data elements. When submitting data to us, you ***do not need to include any of these*** - these are here for us behind the scenes because we're using the same library you are.

Another way to look at it is this is all the stuff you had to repeat on every single segment, despite that 99% of it never changed. Cutting fluff.

| Property Name     | Data Type | Description                                                                       | Required |

| EntireLineSegment | String    | Entire Legacy Flat File line (Segment) that was read in                           | No       |
| SegmentDescriptor | String    | First two digits of the Flat File Segment to tell us what it was (10, 20, etc...) | No       |
| ActionType        | String    | Action Type that the Segment was trying to perform                                | No       |
| ORINumber         | String    | ORI of the Submitting Agency                                                      | No       |
| IncidentNumber    | String    | Incident Number the Segment is associated with                                    | No       |
| ExpansionBuffer   | String    | Blank Space left for future expansion                                             | No       |
| SegmentEnd        | String    | ZZ at the end of the data                                                         | No       |
| Padding           | String    | Blank Spaces to make the line 150 Characters long.                                | No       |
