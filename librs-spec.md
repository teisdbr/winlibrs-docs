# LIBRS Specifications Documentation

This document contains information about the Segments, Data Elements, Requirements, Errors, and Warnings that LIBRS uses in the validation of Incident Data.

## Required Segments

The LIBRS Flat File is a space-delimited file generated by following the requirements in this document. Each section of this document outlines individual Segments. Each Segment is an individual lines in the LIBRS Flat File that contain varying information about the incident. Those bits of information are bound by the LIBRS Data Elements and their definitions/available values.

The information from an RMS needs to be output to the LIBRS Flat File in the exact specifications that are listed in this document. If not, a number of errors will occur. These errors and their common causes and resolutions can be found in the [Data Elements Defintions](./librs-spec/#librs-data-element-definitions) section of this page.

In the event that no incident data is present for submission, the LIBRS Flat File should contain two Segments followed by a blank line (three lines in total):

    Submission Header (00)
	    Submission Trailer (99)
	    [Blank Line]

Alternative Zero Submission Format (Both behave the same way, use whatever works best for you):

    Submission Header (00)
	    Zero Record (01)
	    Submission Trailer (99)

Whenever you are submitting a file with data, however, the following segments should always be included for all Incidents that have a value of 'I' for [DE C5](./librs-spec#action-type-c5):

    00 - Submission Header
	    10 - Administrative Segment
	    20 - Offense Segment
	    40 - Offender Segment
	    41 - Offender Using Segment/Gaming Motivation
	    50 - Victim Segment
	    99 - Submission Trailer

Whenever you want to submit a Deletion to us (used to either permanently remove an Incident from being reported, or simply to delete and re-add because there are changes that have been made to the Incident that need to be reflected) you need to ensure the following is included:

    00 - Submission Header
	    10 - Administrative Segment (With DE C5 - Action Type = 'D')
	    99 - Submission Trailer

Please note in all of these cases, the Submission Header and Trailer should only occur once per file. You can use any of the action types in the same Flat File. For instance, you can include all of the Deletes you'd like to make and the top of the file (after the Submission Header) and then follow it up with all of the Insertions that you'd like to make, or if you prefer include the Delete line just before the Insertion Segments for the Incident; it's purely personal preference.

| Format Symbol | Format Meaning |
| :-----------: | -------------- |
|       N       | Numeric        |
|       A       | Alphabetic     |
|      A/N      | Alpha/Numeric  |

# LIBRS Segments

---

LIBRS, like NIBRS, it built up on Segments that contain different information about the Incidents that are being reported. This portion of this document outlines the LIBRS Segments, and the building blocks (Referred to as Data Elements) That make them up.

## Submission Header (00)

---

### Description

The Submission Header contains the information related to the Agency that is submitting the LIBRS Flat File, as well as information about the file itself, such as the Reporting Period it encompasses and the Spec Version that it was generated with (Currently we are only accepting LIBRS Spec 2.5)

## Zero Record (01)

---

### Description

Segment 01 is used when there are no Incidents to report; IE a Zero Report. The segment can only be used when there are no Incidents present in the Flat File; there cannot be any Segments present other than 00, 01, and 99:

* -Header Segment-
* 01000000000000ZZ
* 99000003ZZ

## Administrative (10)

---

### Description

The Administrative Segment contains basic information about the Incident that is being reported. It acts as the indication for LIBRS that a the next portion of Information is for a different incident from the previous on that was processed. This segment should always be included when:

* Performing an Action Type of 'I - Insertion' for an Incident.
* Performing a 'D - Deletion' Action Type for an Incident.
  * If you desire to delete and resubmit the Incident (easiest way to process changes for us), then simply insert a Segment 10 with a 'D' as [DE C5](./librs-spec#action-type-c5) , followed by the whole incident again (including another Segment 10 with a 'I' for [C5](./librs-spec#action-type-c5)).

## Administrative Modification (11)

---

### Description

Segment 11, Administrative Modification, is only used when performing an update to a Time Window Submission Incident (DE C5, Action Type = ‘M’). Agencies should be aware that information submitted via time windows is stored separately by the FBI and is not combined back in with normal submissions and may or may not be reported in some publications  nor counted towards overall totals.

## Offense (20)

---

### Description

Segment 20, Offense Segment, contains information about the particular Offenses that occurred in the Incident. Note that only one Victim can be tied to an Offense, so if you have multiple Victims of the same Offense you will need to include multiple Segment 20's to link those Victims to the Offense.

We get a lot of questions about this Segment, and have included more information about it in the FAQ, which can be found [here](./faq#offenses-segment-20).

### Important Notes

* Only one Victim can be related to an Offense Segment. If you have multiple Victims of the same offense, you need to include multiple Offense Segments that link to those Victims.
* Please note that DE's 12 and 13 are actually three Data Elements Combined into one. Each instance of the Data Element is either 1 or 3 characters long and can include up to 3 instances, so long as mutually exclusive values are not used.
  * See [Type of Criminal Activity/Gang Information Nos. 1, 2 and 3](./librs-spec#type-of-criminal-activitygang-information-12) and [Type of Weapon/Force Involved Nos. 1, 2, and 3 ](./librs-spec#type-of-weaponforce-involved-nos-1-2-and-3-13) for more details.

## Property (30)

---

### Description

Segment 30, Property Segment, is used to identify that Properties are involved in the listed Offenses. It only contains general information about these Properties, such as the number of Stolen or Recovered Vehicles. Further Details are expected to be entered in Segments 31, 32, and 33.

We get a lot of questions about this Segment, and have included more information about it in the FAQ, which can be found [here](./faq#properties-segments-30-31-32-and-33).

***Note: There should only be ONE Segment 30 per Incident***

## Property/Offense (33)

---

### Description

Segment 33, Property/Offense Relationship, is used to distinctly relate a Property to an Offense. This Segment is not mandatory, though you will most likely experience Errors if you do not include it.

When this segment is not included, LIBRS will perform a Cross Product between all Properties and all Offenses. We have measures in place to help limit incorrect Properties from being associted with Invalid Offenses (EG: Drugs being associated with Motor Vehicle Theft Offenses), however the best way to ensure that Properties are being appropriately linked up to their Offenses is by including a Segment 33 for each Property/Offense Relationship.

We get a lot of questions about this Segment, and have included more information about it in the FAQ, which can be found [here](./faq#properties-segments-30-31-32-and-33).

#### Important Notes:

* The Property/Offense Segment is used to connect incident property (stolen, retrieved, etc.) to an offense. This connection, or relationship, is established using the Property Sequence Number (Data Element P1) and the Offense Sequence Number (Data Element L6).
* This Segment *is optional* in the sense that if it is missing LIBRS will interpret properties to offenses automatically using a cross product (EG all offenses are associated with all properties). Depending on the Offenses in the Incident, this can cause LIBRS to infer properties to incompatible Offenses.
* LIBRS uses the NIBRS Code of the Offenses to determine if it should apply properties to them to minimize the cases that this happens in. However, there are some NIBRS Codes that include both 'Crimes Against People' and 'Crimes Against Property' Offenses.
  * EG: 13B Contains both LRS 14:35 (Simple Battery - Crime Against Person) as well as LRS 14:60 (Aggravated Burglary - Crime Against Property) that break this assumption. Therefore it is always best to include this Segment when Properties are involved.

#### Successful Segment 33 Inference Example

An incident is submitted with a NIBRS 23H 'Crime Against Property' Offense, as well as a NIBRS 11A 'Crime Against Person' Offense, along with one or more properties that are intended to be linked to the 23H Offense. Since NIBRS 11A has no related Offenses that are a 'Crime Against Property', if Segment 33 is missing LIBRS knows that it should not apply the properties to the 11A Offense. As a result, LIBRS will only infer the properties to be related to the 23H Offense, successfully validating the Incident submission.

#### Unsuccessful Segment 33 Inference Example

An incident is submitted with a NIBRS 23H 'Crime Against Property' Offense, as well as a NIBRS 13B 'Crime Against Person' Offense, along with one or more properties that are intended to be linked to the 23H Offense. Since 13B has some offenses that are 'Crime Against Property', if Segment 33 is missing LIBRS cannot know that it shouldn't apply the properties to the 13B Offense. As a result, LIBRS will interpret all properties to be related to all offenses, which in this case will throw validation errors.

### Ivalid Combinations of NIBRS Offense Codes and Property Descriptions

There are a number of illogical combinations for various NIBRS Offense Codes (Data Element 6) having certain Property Descriptions (Data Element 15). For example, it is illogical for Purse Snatching (NIBRS Code 23B) to be connected to property having a Property Description data value of Aircraft (01) or Livestock (18).

The table below shows invalid combinations of NIBRS Offense Codes and Property Descriptions. X's on this table represent that the combination of the Property Description and NIBRS Code are incompatible and should **NOT** be used together.

## Offender (40)

---

### Description

Segment 40, Offender Segment, is used to submit information about the suspected Offender(s) that are involved in an Incident. You should have as many Offender Segments as you have Suspects.

Offenders are linked to their Offenses by their Victims. Segment 20 - Offense Segment contains a Victim Sequence Number that denotes who the victim of the Offense was. Segment 52 - Victim/Offender Relationship then links the Offender to the Victim, which, in turn, links the Offender to the Offense.

More information and common questions and errors can be found on the LIBRS FAQ for this Segment [here](./faq#offenders-segments-40-and-41).

## Victim (50)

---

### Description

Segment 50, Victim Segment, is used to report the relevent personal attributes of the Victims of the Offenses in the Incident. You should have as many Segment 50's as you have unique Victims. This means you should not repeat Society as a Victim for each Offense that is a Crime Against Society, and instead only have a single Segment 50 to represent it.

More information and common questions and errors can be found on the LIBRS FAQ for this Segment [here](./faq#victims-segments-50-51-and-52).

## Victim Injury (51)

---

### Description

Segment 51, Victim Injury, includes information about the sustained Injuries of a Victim of an Offense.

The main thing to note about it is that it required to be included when a Segment 50 (Victim Segment) is present with a Victim Type of 'I - Individual' or 'L - Law Enforcement', and the Offense is of one of the following NIBRS Codes:
{::nomarkdown}`<script>`document.write(window.derequiresnibrs.de33)`</script>`{:/}

Otherwise, it should NOT be included. Additionally, you should not supply a Segment 51 without an Injury Type (DE 33).

More information and common questions and errors can be found on the LIBRS FAQ for this Segment [here](./faq#victims-segments-50-51-and-52).

## Victim/Offender Relation (52)

---

### Description

Segment 52, Victim/Offender Relationship, is what links the Victims to the Offenders, and thereby links the Offenders to the Offenses.

If a Victim of Type 'I - Individual' or 'L - Law Enforcement' is present in the Incident, and the Offense is a Crime Against Person or a Robbery, then this Segment needs to be included. Otherwise it should NOT be included.

More information and common questions and errors can be found on the LIBRS FAQ for this Segment [here](./faq#victims-segments-50-51-and-52).

## Arrestee (60)

---

### Description

Segment 60, Arrestee Segment, is used to define whether or not an Offender was arrested for an Offense or not. Since Offenders can be known but not apprehended, there needs to be another Segment that details the information about their Arrest when the time comes.

Segment 60 can also be used with Action Type 'A - Arrest' in order to add Arrest Information to an already submitted Incident. Though, it's recommended to simply generate a Delete for the Incident and then resubmit it.

You should include an Arrestee Segment for each Offender that has been arrested in relation to an Offense. While NIBRS allows Arrestees to not be linked to an Offender (EG Someone that's not listed on the Incident is listed as the arrestee for it), LIBRS does not allow this. Any Arrestee that's present in this Segment should also have a Segment 40 (Offender) associated with them.

### Important Notes

* [Data Element 52 - Disposition of Arrestee Under 18](./librs-spec#disposition-of-arrestee-under-18-52) must be included for any arrestee that is ***17 or younger***.
* [Data Element 44 - Multiple Arrestee Indicator](./librs-spec#multiple-arrestee-segment-indicator-44) should be used when an Offender is Arrested and associated with more than one Incident. The arrest of the Individual will clear all Incidents that they are a part of, however it should not be counted that two arrests were made. The Multiple Arrestee Indicator allows you to specify that an individual was arrested for another Incident, which has cleared this Incident by arrest, but to not count this arrest for Crime Statistics.

### Important Notes

* [Data Element C7 - Number of Segments Transferred](./librs-spec#number-of-segments-transferred-c7) should be a six-digit long number that is front-padded with 0's that contains the number of lines in the Flat File (Including the Header and Trailer Segments). For instance, if Segment 99 appears on line number 512 in your Flat File, DE C7 should be '000512', and the full line would read '99000512ZZ' (plus Padding to make 150 characters).

### Definitions:

**Concept of time and place provides:** If more than one crime was committed by the same person or group of persons and the time and space intervals separating them were insignificant, all of the crimes make up a single incident.

**An incident is considered as one or more offenses committed by the same offender or group of offenders acting in concert at the same time and place.**

Acting in concert requires that the offenders actually commit or assist in the commission of the crime(s). The offenders must be aware of, and consent to, the commission of the crime(s); or, even if non-consenting, their actions assist in the commission of the offense(s). This is important because all of the offenders in an incident are considered to have committed all of the offenses in the incident. If one or more of the offenders did not act in concert, then there is more than one incident involved.

**Same time and place means that the time interval between the offenses and the distancebetween the offenses and the distance between the locations where they occurred were insignificant.**

Normally, the offenses must have occurred during an unbroken time duration and at the same or adjourning location(s). However, incidents can also be comprised of offenses which by their nature involve continuing criminal activity by the same offender(s) at different times and places, as long as the activity is deemed to constitute a single criminal transaction. Regarding these situations, the reporting agency will have to use its best judgment.

<div class="newpage"></div>

## Incident Date/Hour (3)

---

**Description:** Date and Time when the incident occurred or started, or at the beginning of the time period in which it occurred, or date of report if unknown. If an incident occurred before the agency's Base Date it should not be reported to LIBRS; it will be rejected if it is. For the most part, this really isn't an issue, as the Base Date for most agencies is from somewhere in 2012. However if you do run into an error regarding it, then you should remove that Incident from being reported.

**Data Characteristics:** 11 Character Alpha. If Unknown, Enter the Reporting Date (MMDDYYYY) followed by an 'R' to indicate the date is not the actual Incident Date, but rather the Reporting Date. Leave the Time blank in this case (Not 0's, but Blank Spaces)

**Format:** MMDDYYYYXHH, Where 'X' is either:

* 'R' to denote that the Incident Date is not known, and the Report Date is being substituted for it
* Or ' ' (G - Blank Space) to denote that the supplied value is the actual Incident Date.

### Important Note:

* In the process to certify an agency as LIBRS-compliant, when an agency reaches the Certification and Production stages, please note the following:
  * The "Base Date" for an agency is the date that agency starts sending actual, live data that both the State and FBI Retain. For most Agencies, this is the date in which they started sending UCR data.
  * If an incident occurred before the agency's "Base Date", but was not reported to LIBRS until after your "Base Date" has been implemented; or this incident was already reported in the UCR summary reports, this incident will be REJECTED **(Error 11073)**.
  * If this happens, contact a member of the LIBRS staff at the Louisiana Commission on Law Enforcement.
  * If this incident was not reported until after your "Base Date" was implemented, your agency may have to submit an adjusted UCR summary form to capture these offenses.

### Details:

* This data element is to be used to enter the month, day, year and hours when the Incident occurred or started, or the beginning of the time period in which it occurred. "Military" twenty-four (24) hour time is to be used.
* If the Incident occurred on or between midnight and 0059, enter "00" for the hour; if on or between 0100 and 0159, enter "01" for the hour if on or between 2300 and 2359, enter "23" for the hour, etc.
* If the Incident occurred at exactly midnight, it is considered to have occurred at the beginning of the next day. Therefore "00" should be entered for the hour, along with the next day's date.
* If the Incident Date is unknown, enter the date of the report with the indicator "R" = Report after the MMDDYYYY of the Report Date.
* If the Incident hour is unknown, leave the hour blank.
* When LIBRS requires a Blank (G), it must be a Blank (G), NOT A ZERO.

It would reject because the Incident Date is prior to the date your agency's data is being kept by the LIBRS and NIBRS databases.``Since this incident CANNOT be accepted into LIBRS and has not been reported to UCR summary, an adjustment would have to be made on UCR Summary forms that apply. |

**Description:** Indicates whether the incident was cleared exceptionally. Note that Clearance of a single Offense will clear the entire Incident, as this data element is present in Segment 10 (Administrative Segment), of which there is only one for each Incident.

**Data Characteristics:** 1 Character Alpha. Cannot be blank, if the Incident is not Cleared Exceptionally then you should use 'N'.

### Details:

* The Cleared Exceptionally data element indicates if the incident has been cleared by an exceptional event such as the death of the offender, and if so, the reason for the clearance. In multiple offense incidents, the exceptional clearance of one offense clears the entire incident. An incident CANNOT BE CLEARED EXCEPTIONALLY if it was previously, or at the same time, cleared by an arrest, (that is, if an Arrestee Segment was or is being submitted).
* In order to clear an offense by exceptional means, ALL of the following four conditions must be met:
  * The investigation must have clearly and definitely established the identity of at least one offender.
  * Sufficient probable cause must have been developed to support the arrest, charging, and prosecution of the offender.
  * The exact location of the offender must be known so that an arrest could be made.
  * There must be a reason outside the control of law enforcement that prevents arresting, charging, and prosecuting the offender.
* DO NOT report exceptional clearance information for justifiable homicide, as no crimes have occurred, in reality.
* The closing of a case or the clearing of it by an agency's policy does not permit exceptionally clearing an offense unless all four conditions are met.

## Offense Sequence Number (L6)

---

**Description:** The Offense Sequence Number is a Uniquely Identifying Value between 001 and 999 that is used throughout the LIBRS Data Segments to identify which particular Offense is being referenced for validation purposes. Each Offense Segment (Segment 20) in an Incident should contain a unique Sequence Number.

**Data Characteristics:** 3 Character Numeric. Cannot be blank and should always be a three-digit number, front-padded with zeros as needed (EG Offense Sequence Number 1 of the Incident would be 001)

### Requirements:

|                  Requirement                  | Requirement Description  |   Error Number   | Error Message           |

## Offense Sequence Number Reference (L6R)

---

**Description:** Offense Sequence Number Reference is used in Segment 33 to relate Properties and Offenses together. It has to match one of the Offense Sequence Numbers (DE L6) that are present in the Segment 20(s) of the Incident, and since it's used to relate Properties to Offenses, the same L6R can be used in Multiple Segment 33's to relate multiple Properties to the Offense.

**Data Characteristics:** 3 Character Numeric, front-padded with Zeros to make a three-digit number (EG Sequence Number 1 would be 001). Must be included in each Segment 33 of the Incident and cannot be left blank or all zeros (000).

### Requirements:

|                  Requirement                  | Requirement Description   |   Error Number   | Error Message           |

---

### Details:

* There is no UNIQUE constraint for the Offense Sequence Number Reference (L6R). This allows for an Offense to relate to many properties if multiple Property/Offense segments are submitted within a single incident.

## Louisiana Revised Statute (6)

---

**Description:** The Louisiana Revised Statute (LRS) Code is the State Statute that and Offender is being charged and/or Arrested for. The [Master LRS List](./lrs-master-list) contains the list of all available LRS Codes that LIBRS is able to have reported to it. Each of these LRS Codes have NIBRS Code(s) associated with them. This allows Officers to report the crime how they intended to the FBI. EG: LRS 14:59/A9 is used to denote that someone shot a firearm at a train. Depending on the circumstances, the Officer may want to report this crime as a Weapons Violation (520) or as a Descrution of Property/Vandalism (290).

LRS Codes also have Subparts and Qualifiers that can be associated with them. These, similarly to the NIBRS Code, allow the Officer to more descriptively report what happened for Statutes that have a broad stroke of ways that it could be violated. More information on Subparts and Qualifiers is below.

**Data Characteristics**: 12 Character Alpha. Cannot be left blank and can only contain one (1) Hyphen (-).

**Format**: TT:SSSS.S/P-I

### Qualifiers and Subparts

Qualifiers and Subparts are additional information that is added to the tail-end of an LRS Code to give more definition about it whenever a statute contains multiple cases that could be reported as different NIBRS Codes. For instance, LRS 14:67 is generally used for Theft, however the item that is being stolen can cause the NIBRS Code that should be used to change (EG: A 14:67 with a 240 NIBRS Code is for if a vehicle is stolen, while a 14:67 with a 23H)

|       1       | When 14:42 is submitted as a Louisiana Revised Statute LRS (6), LIBRS will need Qualifiers to determine if the offense should be classified as a forcible rape or as a forcible sodomy. If the offense is submitted as a**14:42/V**, this would translate to a forcible rape offense, whereas if this offense is submitted as a **14:42/A** this would translate to a forcible sodomy offense.``Without any Qualifiers, LIBRS has no way to determine which offense this LRS should be reported as, and the entire incident would be rejected. The agency will receive the following error message: 'This LRS Code must be submitted with a Qualifier to define offense applicable.' |
|       2       | If an incident involved a robbery (14:64) and a forcible rape (**14:42.1/V**), two LRS offenses should be submitted.

## Agency Supplied NIBRS Code (N6)

---

**Description:** The NIBRS Code that the Agency Supplies is what drives LIBRS Validation. The LRS Code is important to us for analytics purposes, however we use the NIBRS Code to effectively categroize LRS Codes into kinds of offenses, and then perform validation based on which category the LRS Code falls into.

The NIBRS Code also allows Officers to report Offenses in a more specific manner without having to go through the trouble of Subparts and Qualifiers.

**Data Characteristics:** 3 Character AlphaNumeric. Check [here](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/ucr/ucr-2019-1-nibrs-technical-specification.pdf) for a list of the current NIBRS Codes.

### Requirements:

## Offense Attempted/Completed (7)

---

**Description:** Attempted/Completed is how to designate whether or not an Offense occurred to completion, or was merely attempted by the Offender. For instance, an Offender tries to steal a car, but is caught in the act by the police. Since the Offender didn't succeed in stealing the car, this offense would be Attempted.

The only thing to note about this is that Attempted Murder (Attempted 09A) should be reported as a Completed Aggravated Assault (Completed 13A). NIBRS does not allow for 09A Offenses to be Attempted, so instead it should be reported as a Completed Aggravated Assault -- Otherwise, the Offense is reported in the standard fashion.

**Data Characteristics:** 1 Character Alpha. Cannot be left blank, and must have a value of either:

* A - Attempted
* C - Completed

## Offender Suspected of Using/Gaming Motivation (8)

---

**Description:** Offender Suspected of Using/Gaming Motivation gives more context to the Offenses that are being reported. It tells us if an Offender is suspected of being on Drugs/Narcotics or has consumed Alcohol either during or shortly before the Incident Occurred. It also gives context of whether Computer Equipment was used to perpetrate the Crime, and if a Gaming/Gambling activity was a motivating factor in committing the crime.

**Data Characteristics:** Up to 4x, 1 Character Alpha. If you use 'N', then you cannot use any other values, and values cannot repeat (EG: AAGG and CGN are both invalid combinations). At least one value is required to be present, but the other three slots are optional and can be left blank if nothing else applies. If another value does apply, then the mutual exclusivity and duplicate rules need to be followed.

## Bias Motivation/Bias Crime Type (8A)

---

**Description:** Bias Motivation/Crime Type gives insight into the motivation behind an Offender committing a crime. For instance, if the Offender committed the crime because of the Race or Religion of the Victim, that should be noted here.

**Data Characteristics:** 2 Character Alpha. Must be present and can't be blank. If there is no reason to suspect the Offender had a Bias Type against the Victim use '88' for None, but if not enough information is known about the Offender to determine whether or not a Bias Type was a factor in them committing the crime, use '99' for Unknown.

### Requirements:

---

### Details:

* Bias Motivation/Bias Crime Type (8) indicates an Offender's motivation to commit an offense because of their bias against a Victim's race, religion, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, disability group, or other bias.
* Because of the difficulty in ascertaining the Offender's subjective motivation, bias is to be reported only when an investigation reveals sufficient objective facts to lead a reasonable and prudent person to conclude that the Offender's actions were motivated, in whole or in part, by bias.
* In LIBRS, incidents not having facts that indicate biased motivation on the part of the Offender are to be coded as None (88), while incidents involving ambiguous facts (that is, where some facts are present, but not conclusive) are to be coded Unknown (99).
* If any Bias Motivation/Bias Crime Type codes are used, other than None (88) or Unknown (99), then the incident will be considered a hate crime, and the Louisiana Revised Statute (DE 6) probably should be appended with the Hate Crime Penalty Enhancer (-H) to represent enhanced penalties related to hate crimes in LRS 14:107.2.

## Location Type (9)

---

**Description:** Location Type is used as a broad-strokes description of the Location in which an Incident Occurred. It's not meant to give particular location information about the location that an Incident occurred (EG: the Exact Address), but rather a short code that can be used for analytics purposes.

**Data Characteristics:** 2 Character Alpha. Must be included and can't be blank.

|       1       | An assault started in a bar ('03'), continued into an adjoining parking lot ('18'), and ended in the street ('13'). As the bar was the location where the offense was initiated and best describes the circumstances of the crime, Bar/Night Club ('03') should be entered.                                                                                          |
|       2       | Two Offenders robbed a bar. One of the Offenders raped a female customer in the bar while the other Offender stood at the door with a gun. In this case, there is one incident, with two offenses: robbery and forcible rape. The location of the robbery would be Bar/Night Club ('03'), and the location of the forcible rape would also be Bar/Night Club ('03'). |

<br/>

<div class="newpage"></div>

## Number of Premises Entered (10)

---

**Description:** Number of Premises Entered is only to be used if the Incident contains a NIBRS 220 (Burglary) Offense, and the Location Type (DE 9) is 14 or 19. It is the number of individual/separate dwellings or units that were stolen from in the 220 Offense. For instance, a single Hotel may have been burgled, but a dozen units in that hotel were stolen from. Rather than 12 Offenses with the same location, you should use one Offense with a 12 in this Data Element.

This Data Element should be left blank if the 220 Offense did not happen in a Hotel/Motel or Storage Facility, because these are the only two Location Types that can contain multiple, separate dwellings/units at the same address (Apartments each have an Apartment Number that you can send mail to, and therefore can be considered to be different places for the Time and Place consideration).

**Data Characteristics:** 2 Character Numeric. If the described conditions don't apply, then this value should be left as Blank Spaces (G). Otherwise it should include a two digit number, using 01, 02, 03, etc... for single-digit numbers.

### Requirements:

---

---

### Details:

* This data element is used only if the offense is burglary and the "Hotel Rule" is applicable.  In such cases, the number of structures (premises) entered is to be reported.  If the LRS offense (6) is not reportable as a Burglary (NIBRS 220), then this data element MUST be left blank.
* In the Summary UCR Reporting System, the "Hotel Rule" is only applied to temporary lodging.  It states: If a number of dwelling units under a single manager are burglarized, then the offenses are most likely to be reported to the police by the manager rather than the individual tenants. The burglary should be reported as a single offense.  The total number of individual rooms, units, storage compartments, etc. entered is to be reported into this data element.
* In LIBRS the "Hotel Rule" has been expanded to include rental storage facilities, i.e., "mini-storage" and "self storage" buildings.

### Examples:

| Example Number | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|       1       | A 'self-storage' building was burglarized and 11 rented storage compartments were forcibly entered. The number '11' (for eleven compartments) should be entered into Number of Premises Entered (DE 10). |

---

<br/>

<div class="newpage"></div>

## Method of Entry (11)

---

**Description:** Method of Entry should only be used when there is an Offense Type of NIBRS 220. Unlike Number of Premises Entered (DE 10), there is no restriction on if it can only be used with certain Location Types. Any location Type that is valid for use in a Burglary should include this Data Element. The available values are 'F' for Forced Entry (breaking of a window or door to gain access) and 'N' for Non-Forced Entry (picking a lock or going through an open window to gain access).

**Data Characteristics:** 1 Character Alpha. Should be left blank unless the NIBRS Code is a 220 (Burglary) Offense.

### Details:

* This data element is to report whether force or no force was used by the burglar(s) to enter the structure.
* A forced entry is where force of any degree, or a mechanical contrivance of any kind (including a passkey or skeleton key), was used to unlawfully enter a building or other structure.
* An unforced entry is one where the unlawful entry was achieved without force through an unlocked door or window.
* If both forced and unforced entries were involved in the crime, the entry should be reported as having been accomplished through "Force".

## Type of Criminal Activity/Gang Information (12)

Type of Criminal Activity and Gang Information are combined into a single Data Element. This portion is split into two sections to outline the requirements for each. Which aspect of the Data Element should be used is dependent on the NIBRS Code of the Offense.

## Type of Criminal Activity Nos. 1, 2 and 3 (12)

---

**Description:** Type of Criminal Activity is used to add context to Offenses for when they're passed on to the FBI. For instance, a 35A Offense could just as easily be a single person with some Marijuana on them, or a major drug bust with millions of Dollars of narcotics involved. Adding a value here gives the FBI that context when it comes to Offenses that can be open-ended like that.

**Data Characteristics**: Up to 3x, 1 Character Alpha. If none apply, then leave this Data Element blank. If more than one apply, then make sure that there aren't any duplicate values being reported (EG: BBB).

### Requirements (Criminal Activity):

---

The following requirements are for **Type of Criminal Activity Only**:
